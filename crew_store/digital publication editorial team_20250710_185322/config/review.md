## Task Changes

[Select Guiding Input Variables]
- Before: `Identify and select the 1-3 most relevant variables from the provided input data that will serve as the foundation and guiderails for writing the three full articles. These variables must be explicitly referenced in all article task descriptions and outputs to ensure alignment with the crew's overall purpose and output objectives.`
- After: `Identify and select the 1-3 most relevant variables from the provided input data (e.g., {raw_materials}, {brand_guidance}, {target_audience}, {seo_keywords}, {main_topics}, {writing_style}, {content_length}, {user_personal_insights}) that will serve as the foundation and guiderails for writing the three full articles. These variables must be explicitly referenced in all article task descriptions and outputs to ensure alignment with the crew's overall purpose and output objectives.`
- Justification: Added explicit references to variable names in task description to ensure clarity and reinforce consistent variable usage throughout tasks and outputs, supporting auditability and alignment.

[Develop Article Writing Frameworks]
- Before: `Using the selected input variables (explicitly referenced by their names) as guiderails, create detailed descriptions and structured frameworks for three full articles in markdown format. Each framework must include guidance on adhering to the brand voice and tone, relevance to the target audience, SEO keyword integration, article structure with headings and bullet points, and annotated prompts for user-added personal insights. The frameworks should emphasize adherence to forbidden content restrictions and avoid fabrication of information.`
- After: `Using the selected input variables (explicitly referenced by their names) such as {raw_materials}, {brand_guidance}, {target_audience}, and {seo_keywords} as guiderails, create detailed descriptions and structured frameworks for three full articles in markdown format. Each framework must include explicit guidance to adhere to brand voice and tone, maintain target audience relevance, actively integrate SEO keywords, follow article structure with defined headings and bullet points, and embed annotated prompts for user-added personal insights referencing {user_personal_insights}. The frameworks must strictly prohibit forbidden content and avoid information fabrication.`
- Justification: Incorporated explicit variable references in the task description to ensure variable-driven outputs, improve clarity, and reinforce compliance with variable linkage throughout the frameworks.

[Quality Assurance and Final Output Refinement]
- Before: `Review and refine the article frameworks against the initial guiding input variables to ensure all crew output objectives are met. This includes verification that content aligns with brand guidance, is relevant to the target audience, incorporates SEO keywords effectively, uses the requested writing style, and includes clear user guidance without overstepping to author content. Ensure no forbidden content is present and that the instructions for user personal insights are clear and actionable.`
- After: `Review and refine the article frameworks against the initial guiding input variables (such as {brand_guidance}, {target_audience}, {seo_keywords}, {writing_style}, {user_personal_insights}) to ensure all crew output objectives are met. Confirm that content aligns with brand guidance, targets the specified audience effectively, incorporates SEO keywords appropriately, and adheres strictly to the requested writing style. Verify that instructions for user personal insights referencing {user_personal_insights} are clear, actionable, and do not author content for the user. Confirm exclusion of any forbidden_content references.`
- Justification: Added explicit variable references in goal statements to improve traceability and consistency of QA efforts regarding variable linkage.

## Agent Consolidations

[Input Analyst Agent, Quality Assurance Agent]
- Before: 
  `Input Analyst Agent
  - Role: Input Analyst
  - Goal: To identify and select the top 1-3 core input variables from the project's given dataset that will govern the overall approach and foundation for writing the three full articles.

  Quality Assurance Agent
  - Role: Quality Assurance Specialist
  - Goal: To rigorously review and refine the article frameworks produced by the Content Designer to guarantee compliance with the selected guiding input variables and overall quality assurance.`
- After: 
  `Input & Quality Assurance Specialist Agent
  - Role: Input Analysis and Quality Assurance
  - Goal: To identify and select the top 1-3 core input variables for article guiding framework and then rigorously review and refine article frameworks to guarantee compliance with those variables and ensure brand consistency, target audience relevance, SEO integration, style adherence, and exclusion of forbidden content. This merged agent consolidates the research-driven selection and quality assurance oversight roles, reducing handoffs and improving continuity across variable selection and QA phases.`
- Justification: Both agents share substantial overlap in deep knowledge of input variables and influence on content accuracy and alignment. Merging reduces resource duplication, improves communication, speeds task transitions, and consolidates oversight over variable consistency without risking bottlenecks due to streamlined scope and complementary skills.

## Variable References

[Task Descriptions]
- Missing: `explicit references to guiding input variables using {variable_name} syntax`
- Added to: `All task descriptions and expected outputs, specifically: Select Guiding Input Variables, Develop Article Writing Frameworks, Quality Assurance and Final Output Refinement`
- Justification: Explicit inclusion of variable references in all tasks enhances traceability, enforces alignment with project inputs throughout task execution, and supports clear contextual guidance to agents, reducing risk of disconnect between input data and output content.

[Agent Goals and Backstories]
- Missing: `reference to constraints or expectations related to variable usage, such as adhering to {brand_guidance}, including {user_personal_insights}`
- Added to: `Agent goals and backstories, for Input Analyst Agent (Olivia), Content Designer Agent (Marco), and Quality Assurance Agent (Sophia)`
- Justification: Embedding variable constraints into agent goals and backstories reinforces agent awareness of variable criticality, improving adherence and outcome consistency, and framing their actions within the broader project guiding input framework.

---

## Documentation Quality

- Role Naming Conventions:
  - Verified consistent use of Agent role titles matching their responsibilities.
  - Suggested standardizing titles to explicit formats (e.g., “Input Analyst”, “Content Designer”, “Quality Assurance Specialist”) without variation.
- Variable Reference Format:
  - Ensured all variable references follow consistent `{variable_name}` syntax.
- Agent Backstories:
  - Reviewed for comprehensiveness post-consolidation.
  - Maintained original descriptive detail; updated merged agent backstory to reflect combined expertise and responsibilities for clarity and team understanding.
