select_key_input_variables:

    Identify the 1-3 most relevant input variables from the crew's design input that
    will guide the article creation process. These variables must be explicitly referenced
    in task outputs to ensure alignment with the article objectives.

design_article_frameworks:
  description: >-
    Develop structured article frameworks for three full articles in markdown format.
    Each framework must incorporate the selected key input variables, adhere to the
    brand guidelines and tone of voice, and demonstrate relevance to the target audience.
    The frameworks should include headings, subheadings, bullet points, SEO keywords,
    and placeholders for personal experience as per {personal_experience_guidance}.
    The frameworks should provide explicit guidance without writing the article content
    for the user.
  expected_output: >-
    Three detailed article frameworks in markdown format that explicitly reference
    {raw_materials}, {brand_guidelines}, {target_audience}, {tone_of_voice}, {seo_keywords},
    {article_structure_preferences}, and {personal_experience_guidance}. Frameworks
    must be structured for user customization and avoid fabrication or assumptions.

    guidance without authoring content on the userâ€™s behalf.
  expected_output: >-
    A validation report confirming all three article frameworks strictly follow {brand_guidelines},
    {output_format}, and all other selected input variables. Ensure deliverables match
